# Advanced Spatial Analysis

## Assignment 5

Due Tuesday 16 April by 23:59 via Blackboard submission.

Choose two US cities. Create a new Jupyter notebook. Use OSMnx to download their street networks and then conduct the following analyses to compare each to the other:

  1. How many intersections and street segments does the network have?
  1. What is the network's overall intersection density per square mile?
  1. What is the average street segment length?
  1. What is the average street circuity?

Finally, choose two points in each network, and calculate and visualize the shortest path between them. Make sure your notebook runs from the top without any errors and that all the visuals/output can be seen inline (without me having to re-run it). Restart your kernel, run all cells, then save/submit your notebook and any necessary data files, zipped, via Blackboard.
