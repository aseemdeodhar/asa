# PPUA 7237: Advanced Spatial Analysis

## Course Overview

Each week will focus on a single thematic learning module consisting of a lecture and a workshop. The former will introduce core concepts and methods for a specific spatial analysis skill and the latter allows the students to practice these skills together in class. This syllabus is a living document and may be updated by the instructor throughout the semester.

This course takes a computational social science approach to spatial analysis. It uses Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate coding and geospatial methods that students can reproduce and experiment with in real-time in the classroom. We start the semester with the fundamentals of coding, then move on to data wrangling and analysis, then on to the theory and practice of analytical visualization, web mapping, spatial analysis, and applied spatial statistics. Building up core concepts in this way gives students the confidence of fundamental quick-wins before moving on to high-level applications.

Each week, students will be expected to:

  1. Complete all assigned readings
  2. Attend the lecture
  3. Participate in the workshop exercises following the lecture
  4. Complete and submit any assignments

The course has no specific prerequisites, but students are expected to have prior experience with GIS and basic statistics. Python will be taught from the ground-up.

## Materials

Reading materials will be provided on blackboard. The course lectures assume you that have read the assigned readings prior to course and are now reasonably fluent in their contents.

Coursework will be based on free and/or open-source software including Anaconda Python, QGIS, Carto, Docker, Git.

## Assignments and Evaluation

Final grades will be assigned according to the following:

  - 50%: 5 assignments (10% each)
  - 40%: final project
  - 10%: attendance and active participation in the classroom

Assignments are due by 23:59 eastern time on their due date, to be submitted on blackboard. Late assignment submissions will be deducted 20% per day. Late final project submissions will not be accepted or graded.

Assignments will be graded on the following critera: does your code fully run? Does it do what it's supposed to do the way it's supposed to do it? Is it well-commented and documented? Is your code clear, straightforward, and reasonably efficient?
